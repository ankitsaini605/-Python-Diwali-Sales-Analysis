📊 Diwali Sales Analysis – Python Project

🔹 Overview

This project is a Python‑based sales analysis on Diwali sales data. The goal was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), clean and transform raw data, and uncover actionable business insights about customer behavior, demographics, and purchasing patterns.

🔹 Objectives

• Clean and preprocess raw sales data (handling nulls, dropping irrelevant columns, type conversions).

• Perform exploratory data analysis using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

• Visualize customer trends across gender, age groups, states, marital status, occupation, and product categories.

• Identify top contributing states, product categories, and customer segments.

• Derive business insights to improve customer targeting and sales strategies.

🔹 Tech Stack

• Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning & manipulation

• Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

• Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis environment

• CSV Dataset – Diwali Sales Data

🔹 Key Analysis & Insights

• Gender Analysis: Women contributed more to overall sales compared to men.

• Age Group: Customers aged 26–35 years were the highest spenders.

• State‑wise: Top contributing states were Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.

• Marital Status: Married women showed higher purchasing power.

• Occupation: Customers from IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors dominated purchases.

• Product Categories: Food, Clothing, and Electronics were the most popular categories.

🔹 Conclusion

Married women aged 26–35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

This analysis can help businesses optimize marketing strategies, personalize offers, and boost sales during festive seasons.
